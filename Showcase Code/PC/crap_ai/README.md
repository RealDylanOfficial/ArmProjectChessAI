# ROBOSOC_Chess_AI

Fork of the RoboSoc "Arm Chess Bot" (C.R.A.P) Repository for the current year 2023 - 2024


# Individual Work Structure
As the team expands, it is currently expected of each individual team member to pick a file **not** currently listed in *Individual Documentation* or *Group Documentation* and begin documenting how their chosen file works. This is presently done for the benefit of code literacy, such that further features may be implemented in future.
  **Group Documentation** is to be worked on by the team within labs or via collaboration over any form of social media. 

During each Wednesday 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM Session the team will collaborate on the work done in the previous session or in their own time, to keep people up to date.
